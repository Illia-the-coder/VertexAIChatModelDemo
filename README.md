# Vertex AI Chat Model Demo 🤖💬

Welcome to the Vertex AI Chat Model Demo repository! This project demonstrates how to utilize Google Cloud's Vertex AI to build and interact with a chat model. The code is presented in a Jupyter Notebook environment, making it easy to follow along and experiment.

## 📜 Overview

This repository provides a Jupyter Notebook (`VertexAI.ipynb`) that illustrates how to:

- Set up the necessary environment using virtual environments
- Authenticate with Google Cloud services
- Initialize a chat model using Vertex AI
- Customize chat interaction parameters
- Interact with the chat model to generate responses
